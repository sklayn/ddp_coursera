# Shiny app - bathing water status - Europe
## Course project - Developing Data Products, Coursera

This is the code for the Shiny app I made for my final course project of the course "Developing Data Products" on Coursera.
The app visualizes the status of bathing waters in Europe, assessed under the Bathing Waters Directive. EU Member States monitor and report the status of fresh and coastal waters used for bathing, and provide a quality assessment based on microbiological pollution.   
*Note Data are not included in this repo, because the file is too large for GitHub. The individual country files can be downloaded from the EEA website (link below).*

## App 
The corresponding app is deployed on RStudio's server: https://sklayn.shinyapps.io/eu_bw_status/

## Data availability  
Data are available from the [EEA](https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/bathing-water-directive-status-of-bathing-water-13), and are free to reuse with attribution.
